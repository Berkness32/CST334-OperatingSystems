# Programming Assignments Overview

These are the programming assignments for CST334.
In general, there are 2 weeks per assignment, with a checkpoint to be completed after the first week.

If you look through the code, you will notice several notes I had written to myself while working through the assignments. 
In addition, there are a few comments that the professor had given us to help direct the assignments.
